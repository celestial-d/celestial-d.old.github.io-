Hi! I'm Duo Zhang, a Ph.D. student in [Data Storage Lab](https://www.ece.iastate.edu/~mai/lab/dsl.html) at Iowa State University. I'm interested in all things involving the storage system. 

My work and research
======
My current research focuses on exploration of bug reproducibilities and the reliability issues of the storage system with emerging storage technologies (e.g., persistent memory). I am interested in developing a virtual machine-based full stack crash consistency testing framework without relying on hardware. My project involves virtual machines (QEMU), tracers(e.g., kprobe) and static analysis (LLVM).
